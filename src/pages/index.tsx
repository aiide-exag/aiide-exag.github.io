                    <p>
                        The Experimental AI in Games (EXAG) workshop is a
                        workshop held at the AI for Interactive Digital
                        Entertainment conference (AIIDE). At EXAG, AI
                        practitioners from academia and industry are given a
                        platform to showcase their work on new applications of
                        AI in games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        EXAG will be taking place for its 11th year at the 2024
                        AIIDE AIIDE Conference. Beyond being just a workshop,
                        EXAG aims to foster a community where new ideas can be
                        proposed and developed within the space of the workshop
                        itself, thanks to sessions that emphasize showing,
                        teaching, and inventing, alongside the traditional paper
                        presentations. We hope to continuously support the
                        presence of diverse voices from diverse backgrounds, in
                        our AIIDE community, through new participants choosing
                        to attend the broader conference.
