        "abstract": "Non-representational art-such as works by Wassily Kandinsky, Joan Mitchell, Willem de Kooning, etc.-showcases diverse artistic expressions and challenges viewers with its interpretive open-endedness and lack of a clear mapping to our everyday reality. Human cognition and perception nonetheless aid us in making sense of, reasoning about, and discussing the perceptual features prevalent in such non-representational art. While there have been various Computational Creative systems capable of generating representational artwork, only a few existing Computational (Co)Creative systems for visual arts can produce non-representational art. How would a co-creative AI that incorporates elements of the human visual perception theory be able to collaborate with a human in co-creating a non-representational art? This paper explores this challenge in detail, describes potential machine learning and non-machine learning approaches for designing an AI agent and introduces a new web-based, multi-agent AI drawing application, called Drawcto, capable of co-creating non-representational artwork with human collaborators.",

        "abstract": "Generative Graph grammars are an established technique for procedural content generation (PCG) of the mission space of dungeon levels, as they allow for explicit specification of design intention. However, they are difficult to control beyond the initial specification. Defining effective grammars requires both design expertise and familiarity with how grammars work, and even then the resulting grammar is not guaranteed to generate missions that fit a designer's intention. In this paper, we propose a system that attempts to allow designers to affect an existing grammar's generative space by allowing designers to control the probability distribution induced by the grammar. The system does this by learning the parameters of a probabilistic graph grammar from examples. Designers can control the generation of these examples via specification of assessment criteria, and a threshold above or below which the output is generated. We conclude with a demonstration of the efficacy of the system in shifting the distribution of the generative space.",

In this work, rather than use BTs to model game playing agents, we use them for modeling game design agents, defining behaviors as content generation tasks rather than in-game actions. Similar to how traditional BTs enable modeling behaviors in a modular and dynamic manner, BTs for PCG enable simple subtrees for generating parts of levels to be combined modularly to form complex trees for generating whole levels as well as generators that can dynamically vary the generated content. We refer to this approach as Procedural Content Generation using Behavior Trees, or PCGBT, and demonstrate it by using BTs to model generators for Super Mario Bros., Mega Man and Metroid levels as well as dungeon layouts and discuss several ways in which this paradigm could be applied and extended in the future.",

The horror features found in the ludology are separated into a distinct hierarchy: low-level features and high-level features. These features are used in conjunction with a procedurally generated tilemap to create an annotated map denoting candidate locations for strong horror moments. This system is evaluated using a series of pathfinding agents which score the annotated tilemap.

These typically take the form of a simple binary opposition between good and evil, in which game actions are sorted into these categories, and reputation systems that track the reputation of players (and sometimes NPCs) with in-game factions based on the actions taken. This paper presents a more sophisticated model of moral reasoning based on Lakoff's metaphorical family models: the strict father and nurturant parent morality. This model utilizes more rapid, surface level categorization of different situations in moral categories, and deeper reasoning that characterizes situations in terms of their relationship to moral virtues as determined by the metaphor value system. This model is used in the experimental prototype Argument Box (AB), a social argument simulator where the player argues with clients visiting the shop. Arguments in AB center around the moral virtues and vices of simulated characters in the social simulation Talk Of the Town.

In this work, we present a constraint-based PCGML approach for platformers with physics-based player movement that guarantees playability and provides design controllability. Our approach exhaustively precomputes all possible player movement states in example tile-based platformer levels. It extracts metatiles containing local state information and uses them in constraint-based level generation that ensures legal tile neighbors and consistent movement state transitions. The approach can ensure constraints on gameplay, such as the reachability of goals, guaranteeing level playability, and other elements like platforms and bonuses.

        "abstract": "In this paper we describe the Sharp Multi-input Editing Software (SMES), a prototype system which allows players to convert dexterity challenges to planning challenges in existing games. SMES accomplishes this by recording the player input, displaying it in a visual form, allowing the player to edit the recorded playtrace, and replay the edited sequence back again. Our system combines ideas from tool-assisted speedruns (TAS) with interaction design patterns from Casual Creators and Accessible Player Experiences. Because our implementation is based on intercepting input events at the operating system level, no engineering effort is needed to apply the tool to new games. The result is a new mode of play for existing games that further allows players to realize new behaviors in the game. SMES could support making games more inclusive by letting players adapt the challenge type they face. Furthermore we claim that AI systems that operate over playtraces to assist the player is a rich avenue to explore.",

PCGML approaches rely on black box models, which can be difficult to understand and debug by human designers who do not have expert knowledge about machine learning. This can be even more tricky in co-creative systems where human designers must interact with AI agents to generate game content. In this paper we present an approach to explainable artificial intelligence in which certain training instances are offered to human users as an explanation for the AI agent's actions during a co-creation process. We evaluate this approach by approximating its ability to provide human users with the explanations of AI agent's actions and helping them to more efficiently cooperate with the AI agent.",

        "abstract": "A key concern for procedural level generation is ensuring that generated levels are in fact playable. One approach for determining playability is using pathfinding agents to test if generated levels can be completed. This typically involves following an iterative loop of generating candidate levels until the agent is able to successfully complete a playthrough, discarding the failed level and starting the generation process over each time the agent fails. In this paper, we present a new approach for generating playable levels that leverages pathfinding agents, not to simply test levels for playability, but to perform level repair to fix generated levels that are unplayable. By augmenting a simple pathfinding agent to be able to take moves that would require modifying the level, our approach can fix unplayable levels without having to regenerate a new level from scratch. We compared our repair agent to a default agent on three PCGML level generators each for Super Mario Bros. and Kid Icarus, and found the repair agent was able to fix the majority of levels, taking time that ranged from similar to the default agent to around 4x its time.",

In July 2018, we released an update to our simulative science fantasy roguelike Caves of Qud (Freehold Games 2015) that added its own take on dynamically generated villages and quests. These systems were built on top of a framework we previously developed for generating historical biographies (Grinblat and Bucklew 2017). Like that framework, our approach to dynamic quest generation-novel in the space as far as we know-was shaped primarily by two design forces at work in the project's development. The first is an architectural constraint; to support its large-scale game worlds, Caves of Qud uses a two-phase approach to world creation (Bucklew and Grinblat 2019) that delays the full fabrication of game 'zones' until the player enters them. The quest generation system was necessarily designed to fit this two-tiered architecture. The second is an aesthetic choice of procedural content design; we tend to be nonprescriptive in deciding which of our content modules can be procedurally combined, preferring instead to 'let our generators run wild,' as we say, but ensure that they smooth the rough edges off their output. For our storyful generators, this means eschewing causal logic in favor of randomness that's parameterized by the richly narrative world the generators are embedded in. The resulting outputs are ripe for apophenic readings.",

Modern versions often provide players with the ability to silently eliminate enemies, inducing a puzzle-like nature to the task which combines finding a path to the goal with the need to discover an order in which enemies can be eliminated. This 'take-down' problem is made more complex by the need to hide the resulting enemy body from future observation. We present a version of a sample-based search that can find paths respecting the stealth constraints of both the take-down and body-hiding mechanics, including multiple variations that address different ways these problems are expressed in games. As a perhaps surprising outcome of our analysis, we show that an additional body-hiding problem can improve the success rate, despite the apparent increase in task complexity.",

A key objective of procedural level generation is controllability: the ability to generate novel levels with a predetermined goal, such as maximizing difficulty. Previous work has achieved this for platformer games using deep-learning and evolutionary methods, but such methods often lead to invalid or asymmetric structures within the generated levels. On the other hand, generative approaches using LSTMs and Markov chains have succeeded in preserving local coherence but suffer from limited controllability. In this paper, we introduce a framework for generating controllable and locally coherent levels in platformer games. Our framework extends a prior GAN and evolutionary strategy-based approach with LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks and hyperparameter optimization. We use sequence transformation via a LSTM to improve aesthetic coherency, while tuning fitness function hyperparameters for specific objectives and measuring overall level quality through human evaluation. To verify our approach, we create levels for Super Mario Bros intended to be novel and challenging to expert players. We demonstrate that the framework is able to successfully generate such levels in a controllable manner, while also resolving invalid and unaesthetic local structures.",

In this demonstration we present an improvement of the Morai Maker mixed-initiative level editor for Super Mario Bros. that includes automated pathing and challenge approximation features.",

In this paper, we use Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for improving upon such techniques. VAEs are artificial neural networks that learn and use latent representations of datasets to generate novel outputs. We train a VAE on level data from Super Mario Bros. and Kid Icarus, enabling it to capture the latent space spanning both games. We then use this space to generate level segments that combine properties of levels from both games. Moreover, by applying evolutionary search in the latent space, we evolve level segments satisfying specific constraints. We argue that these affordances make the VAE-based approach especially suitable for co-creative level design and compare its performance with similar generative models like the GAN and the VAE-GAN.",

The environment is interactive, allowing a human player to build alongside agents during training and inference, potentially influencing the course of their learning, or manually probing and evaluating their performance. To test our agents' ability to capture distance-agnostic relationships between elements of the gameboard, we design a minigame within the environment which is, by design, unsolvable at large enough scales given strictly local strategies. Given the game engine's extensive use of Cellular Automata, we also train our agents to 'play' Conway's Game of Life - again optimizing for population - and examine their behaviour at multiple scales.

However, how to generate content that embodies design intent is still an open research question. Level designers lack abstractions and tools for authoring generated artifacts for affecting emotion. We propose a novel pattern language for generative level design inspired by Appraisal Theory. Its patterns enable designers to add meaning, depth, and cohesiveness to the resulting content, and modify artifacts to make the content more engaging. We illustrate how these patterns can be implemented in a generative grammar for level generation for an adventure game. Formative evaluation of generated level content demonstrates the feasibility of the approach and suggests points for further improvements.

Our algorithm uses player trajectories to find paths along which to place the coins for each level. We ran an experiment comparing path-based placement to other placement methods. Although we did not find a difference in total time spent playing or likelihood of finishing the game, our results suggest that path-based placement leads to players collecting more coins in less time than with designer or randomly placed coins.

        "abstract": "In recent years, the use of machine learning for procedural content generation (PCGML) has been growing. These PCGML approaches require a training corpus of levels, often annotated or represented in some abstracted way. Due to the manual effort required to annotate or translate a sufficient training corpus, most PCGML techniques have only been explored in a handful of domains. In this paper we take a step towards addressing this core issue of PCGML by presenting an unsupervised method for automatically extracting a representation for a level domain, given only images of the levels. This approach is a move towards making PCGML more broadly applicable by reducing the effort required to create a training corpus. We evaluate our approach by comparing the automatically extracted tile representation against existing PCGML training level corpus representations.",

Cognitive science theories suggest that this learning happens through an iterative process of hypothesizing, failure, and revision of mental models. In this work, we pose the question of what it would take to generate puzzle game levels and progressions that best support player satisfaction and systematic understanding of mechanics by integrating an understanding of player mental models. We present a preliminary investigation consisting of a new puzzle game Laserverse, whose mechanics are designed to interact with each other in a wide array of combinations, a set of hand-authored levels that combine these mechanics hierarchically, and an algorithm for organizing the levels into progressions to test hypotheses based on a theory of mental model formation. This work sets the stage for empirical validation of puzzle game design principles, which in turn inform a new approach to player modeling based on mental model matching theory.",

When NPC behavior is controlled by a black box AI system it can be hard to generate the necessary explanations. In this paper, we present a system that generates human-like, natural language explanations-called rationales-of an agent's actions in a game environment regardless of how the decisions are made by a black box AI. We outline a robust data collection and neural network training pipeline that can be used to gather think-aloud data and train a rationale generation model for any similar sequential turn based decision making task. A human-subject study shows that our technique produces believable rationales for an agent playing the game, Frogger.

Currently, Tarn and his brother, Zach Adams, are roughly midway through its famous 30-year development cycle.

        "abstract": "Procedurally generating rich, naturally behaving AI-controlled video game characters is an important open problem. In this paper we focus on a particular aspect of non-playable character (NPC) behavior, long favored by science-fiction writers. Specifically, we study the effects of self-knowledge on NPC behavior. To do so we adopt the well-known framework of agent-centered real-time heuristic search applied to the standard pathfinding task on video-game maps. Such search agents normally use a heuristic function to guide them around a map to the goal state. Heuristic functions are inaccurate underestimates of the remaining distance to goal. What if the agent somehow knew how long it (the agent) would actually take to reach the goal from each state? How would using such self-knowledge in place of a heuristic function affect the agent's behavior? We show that similarly to real life, knowing of one's irrational behavior in a situation can deter the agent from getting into that situation again even if it is, in fact, a part of an optimal solution. We demonstrate the \"fear\" with a simple example and empirically show that the issue is common in video-game pathfinding. We then analyze the issue theoretically and suggest that \"fear\" induced by self-knowledge is not a bug but a feature and may potentially be used to develop more naturally behaving NPCs.",

As an early step in this direction, we present an in-progress social simulation of group discussion in activist meetings, developed in the already-existing AI system, Ensemble. Through this minimal, highly constrained social arena, we can explore wide-reaching phenomena like privilege, intersectionality, and power dynamics in nonhierarchical groups, but in a way that's grounded in concrete, person-to-person interactions.

        "abstract": "General videogame playing has come a long way in a short period of time, but remains at the level of solving relatively short games made up of distinct and isolated episodes. Even simple console role-playing games (RPGs) are far beyond the reach of current techniques, requiring the synthesis of cultural knowledge with compositional reasoning over several interconnected sub-games. We explore how the challenges of playing these games could spark new advances in compositional analysis of games and common-sense reasoning. General RPG playing can leverage advances in episodic general game playing and in areas like text understanding, image classification, and automated game design learning. It has direct applications in design support and AI-based game design, and the techniques used to enable it could generalize to other families of games such as adventure, open-world, and simulation games. In this paper, we describe the motivation behind general RPG playing in a sub-domain of Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) RPGs, some promising approaches to some of its fundamental issues, and immediate next steps; we conclude by describing a few concrete benchmark problems on the path towards automated play of these complex games.",

Previously, we developed a multi-layer level representation, where each layer is designed to capture specific level information. In this paper, we apply our multi-layer approach to Lode Runner, a game with non-linear paths and complex actions. We test our approach by generating levels for Lode Runner with a constrained multi-dimensional Markov chain (MdMC) approach that ensures playability and a standard MdMC sampling approach.

We approach this problem from an adversarial game perspective, where the IN system's goal is to prevent the player from creating invalid branches.

As more pieces of computationally assisted performance are developed, it will become ever more important to develop a vocabulary with which to describe them. Inspired by previous work in creating taxonomies for other related domains, this paper outlines a taxonomy for performance-based experiences, drawn from digital games, traditional theatre, and the hybrid of the two. Having such a taxonomy not only creates a common language with which to discuss such experiences, but reveals unexplored design space in the field, and the particular applications of artificial intelligence necessary to realize them.",

The domain we focus on is characterized by real-time movement through a continuous space in which the player and opposing boss damage each other through physical collisions, and player and boss behavior is governed primarily by finite state machines. Our programming model consists of primitive systems such as kinematic physics to store object state and detect collisions paired with finite state machines to define behavior. We describe our model and demonstrate its expressiveness with examples of three classic boss fights from games in The Legend of Zelda, Castlevania, and Sonic the Hedgehog. Our future goals include procedural generation of boss encounters, and we report on the research challenges involved in achieving this goal.",

The game was designed so that it is easy for the AI to find optimal solutions while the problem is relatively hard for a human player. We gathered survey responses from players who played the game online (N=28). While the AI sidekick was reported as likeable and helpful, players still reported greater enjoyment of the game when they were allowed to control the sidekick themselves. These findings indicate that the AI itself is not the only obstacle to truly enjoyable gameplay with an AI sidekick.",

The system autonomously produces a variety of puzzles of varying difficulty to create a game called Loki's Castle. The system is almost completely autonomous, requiring only a minimal description of what a puzzle should include, and the abstraction allows extensibility so that future versions can invent entirely new classes of tiles.

Procedural game generation systems require specialized knowledge, virtual worlds, and art assets. In this paper, we show how 3D graphical scenes for interactive fictions can be automatically generated with only knowledge that is readily available in existing knowledge bases or can be acquired via crowdsourcing. The key to 3D scene generation is commonly accepted spatial relationships between different types of objects in different types of scenes. We use a crowdsourcing game to automatically and rapidly acquire spatial relations. The spatial relations are used by an intelligent scene generation system that selects and configures 3D assets within a virtual geometric space.",

I will argue that if we want to build games that leverage high-end classical AI techniques like commonsense reasoning and natural language processing, we will also have to develop new game genres and mechanics that better exploit those capabilities.

We use a least-commitment model of interactive narrative to characterize these knowledge goals and the problem of knowledge goal recognition. As a first attempt to solve the knowledge goal recognition problem, we adapt a classical goal recognition paradigm, but in our empirical evaluation the approach suffers from a high rate of incorrectly rejecting a synthetic player's true goals; we discuss how handling of player goals could be made more robust in practice.",

There is a particular lack regarding the evaluation of generative pipelines, where a set of generative systems work in series to make iterative changes to an artifact. We introduce a novel method called Generative Shift for evaluating the impact of individual stages in a PCG pipeline by quantifying the impact that a generative process has when it is applied to a pre-existing artifact. We explore this technique by applying it to a very rich dataset of Minecraft game maps produced by a set of alternative settlement generators developed as part of the Generative Design in Minecraft Competition (GDMC), all of which are designed to produce appropriate settlements for a pre-existing map. While this is an early exploration of this technique we find it to be a promising lens to apply to PCG evaluation, and we are optimistic about the potential of Generative Shift to be a domain-agnostic method for evaluating generative pipelines.",

        "abstract": "Declarative programming offers several advantages in terms of compactness and modularity. Logic programming and rule-based systems are often chosen for tasks such as social simulation because their use of declarative rules and predicates map well to rules of social engagement. Unfortunately, declarative programming is often quite slow, making it inappropriate for large systems or high-frequency updates. This is partly because of its use of search algorithms, but also because of its heavy use of pointer chasing, dynamic allocation, garbage collection, and runtime type-checking. In this paper, we discuss how bottom-up execution of logic programs can be implemented without these issues. We argue that character simulation is a “sweet spot” for bottom-up logic programming, allowing character behavior to be specified in terms of declarative rules, while offering performance competitive with Python systems such as Talk of the Town. We present a language, TED, which offers very good performance and has been used both in research and in an unannounced commercial game. ",

This is problematic because some players may get stuck if the progression is too difficult and others may find it boring if it is too slow to get to more challenging levels. One way to address this is to build levels based on the player's performance. In this work, we formulate the problem of generating levels for a player as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) to solve the MDP before assembling a level. We tested with two case studies and find that using an ADP outperforms two baselines. Furthermore, we tested with player proxies and switched them in the middle of play, and we show that a simple modification prior to running an ADP results in quick adaptation. By using an ADP, which searches the entire MDP, we produce a dynamic progression of levels that adapts to the player.",

We show that when coupled with simple heuristics derived from the game's navigation mesh, Go-Explore finds challenging bugs and comprehensively explores complex environments without the need for human demonstration or knowledge of the game dynamics. Go-Explore vastly outperforms more complicated baselines including reinforcement learning with intrinsic curiosity in both covering the navigation mesh and number of unique positions across the map discovered.

        "abstract": "Failure and resilience are important aspects of gameplay. This is especially important for serious games or competitive games, where players need to adapt and cope with failure frequently. In such situations, emotion regulation - the active process of modulating ones' emotions to cope and adapt to challenging situations - becomes essential. It is one of the prominent aspects of human intelligence and promotes mental health and well-being. While there has been work on developing artificial emotional regulation assistants to help users cope with emotion regulation in the field of Intelligent Tutoring systems, little is done to incorporate such systems or ideas into (serious) video games. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven 6-phase approach to establish empathetic artificial intelligence (EAI), which operates on raw chat log data to detect key affective states, identify common sequences and emotion regulation strategies and generalizes these to make them applicable for intervention systems.",

        "abstract": "Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game unit generation is a relatively unexplored area of Procedural Content Generation (PCG) research. This leaves the question of how to generate interesting and balanced units largely unanswered. Creating unique and balanced units can be a difficult task when designing an RTS game. Having an automated method of designing units could help developers speed up the creation process as well as find new ideas. In this work we propose a method of generating and testing new units to be introduced into an RTS game. Drawing on Search-Based PCG and a fitness function based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our approach is capable of generating a variety of units. We present ten units generated by our system designed to be used in the game microRTS, as well as test results demonstrating that these units are unique and balanced.",

        "abstract": "We propose to use ontologies and declarative symbolic reasoning to generate emergent behaviours of Non-Player Characters (NPCs). The objective is that the game designer only needs to specify the rules of the game and its components in a declarative way, as he would naturally do in a traditional board game. The logic reasoner will then deduce the NPC behaviours that comply with the game designer's rules without the game designer having to manually specify all the game possibilities by hand. We illustrate this approach on a prototype of the revisited Wumpus World game made on the Unity game engine with a Prolog environment. This approach is combined with the Well-Founded Semantics (WFS) to solve the problem of representation and reasoning despite the lack of NPC knowledge.",
